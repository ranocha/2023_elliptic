## Abstract

Nishikawa (2007) proposed to reformulate the classical Poisson equation as a
steady state problem for a linear hyperbolic system. This results in optimal
error estimates for both the solution of the elliptic equation and its gradient.
However, it prevents the application of well-known solvers for elliptic
problems. We show connections to a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method analyzed
by Cockburn, GuzmÃ¡n, and Wang (2009) that is very difficult to implement in
general. Next, we demonstrate how this method can be implemented efficiently
using summation by parts (SBP) operators, in particular in the context of
SBP DG methods such as the DG spectral element method (DGSEM). The resulting scheme
combines nice properties of both the hyperbolic and the elliptic point of view,
in particular a high order of convergence of the gradients, which is one order
higher than what one would usually expect from DG methods for elliptic problems.


## Numerical experiments

To reproduce the numerical experiments presented in this article, you need
to install [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The numerical experiments presented
in this article were performed using Julia v1.8.3.

First, you need to download this repository, e.g., by cloning it with `git`
or by downloading an archive via the GitHub interface. Then, you need to start
Julia in this directory and execute the following commands in the Julia REPL.

```julia
julia> include("code.jl")

julia> convergence_tests_1d()

julia> convergence_tests_2d()
```

This will show the results in the REPL. If you want to display LaTeX code for
the convergence tables, add the keyword argument `latex = true` to the function
calls shown above.
